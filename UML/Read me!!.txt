Inside this folder there are 3 files

The first is the UL file created using (Apache NetBeans IDE 20) by writing the code correctly and it
creates the UML (this version usually does not carry this feature so I upload it and add it to
Apache NetBeans IDE 20 following video showing the way: https://youtu.be/MiysL0MC2ck?si=54phVQsCPaqL3RGi)

Second: Image for UML

Third: Detailed video of UML in case the picture was not clear enough
