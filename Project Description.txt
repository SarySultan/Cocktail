**Project Description: Cocktail**

**Purpose:**
The purpose of this project is to create a system for mixing various ingredients to produce cocktails.
 It simulates the process of blending fruits, liquids, and sugars to create unique cocktails with different flavors, colors, and nutritional values.


Important!!!

Two things have been added to develop the core project
1- Instead of using milk class replaced with liquid class so that liquid includes
all drinks (such as milk, orange juice, honey, strawberry milk... etc.)

2- The idea is to add a property to the ingredients so that they are classified into 
Sweet taste and sour taste and give a degree of sweetness or  sourness of that ingredient so that, 
for example, sugar is sweet 5/5, lemon is sour 5/5, pineapple is sweet 2/5, 
and so when producing a cocktail the user is told about the expected taste of this cocktail (is sour or sweet) and the degree of its sweet or sour.


**Relationships Between Classes:**


- The `Cup` class is associated with the `Cocktail` class through the `pourCocktail()` method, 
which calculates the calories in one cup based on the cocktail's properties.

- The `Blender` class aggregates instances of `Ingredient` classes to mix them and create a `Cocktail`.

- The `Cocktail` class aggregates instances of `Ingredient` classes to represent the final mixture.

- The `Ingredient` class serves as a base class for `Fruit`, `Liquid`, and `Sugar` classes, providing common properties and behaviors for all ingredients.
